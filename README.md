# Binary-Counter
This is a 3 bit binary counter representation. It counts from 0-7 using an LED representation. An on LED represents a 1 and an off LED represents a 0. The user can increase the speed of the counter and can also reverse the count so that it decrements instead of incrementing. When a count limit is reached (0 or 7), the counter will reset.

# How-To
The use, one should have the Arduino environment and any compatible board kit with a setup similar to the one shown below. The left button speeds up the count and the right button reverses the count.
